## 📂 Project Overview

This project explores how machine learning can predict personality types using simple behavioral indicators like stage fear, social interaction preferences, and more.

It demonstrates the complete Machine Learning from data exploration to model building, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to develop an ML model capable of classifying individuals as **Extroverts** or **Introverts** based on survey-style input features.

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

- Contains various social and behavioral attributes such as:
  - Time spent alone
  - Fear of stage performance
  - Participation in social events
  - ... and more

---

## ⚒️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧩 Machine Learning Models Applied
